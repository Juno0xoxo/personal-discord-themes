# Personal Discord Themes
Credits to [Gibbu](https://github.com/Gibbu) and his [FrostedGlass theme](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/FrostedGlass) that provides an editor to seamlessly create your own themes by altering the original (and his excellent taste of plugins).

## Reason Of Origin
This repository has no other purpose other than to share themes that I have created using the aforementioned editor, you are welcome to use this as you like however do note that I am not the original developer - that title is Gibbu's.

## Supported Clients
- BetterDiscord
- Powercord

## My Theme Is Bugged!!!
If this has happened, it may have been caused by my personal tampering so feel free to let me know and I will do my best to patch it. Anything I am *unable* to patch I will kindly ask that you report the issue to Gibbu by visiting his Discord server, located in his [FrostedGlass repository](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/FrostedGlass) respectively. Besides, he will know more than I about it if I end up being unable to fix it - all I do is make things look nice. :^)
