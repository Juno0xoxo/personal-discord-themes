# Personal BetterDiscord Themes
Credits to [Gibbu](https://github.com/Gibbu) and his [FrostedGlass theme](https://github.com/Gibbu/BetterDiscord-Themes/tree/master/FrostedGlass) that provides an editor to seamlessly create your own themes by altering the original (and his excellent taste of plugins).

## Reason Of Origin
This repository has no other purpose other than to share themes that I have created using the aforementioned editor, you are welcome to use this as you like however do note that I am not the original developer - that title is Gibbu's.

## My Theme Is Bugged!!!
This may have been due to my personal tampering so feel free to let me know and I will do my best to patch it. Any issues I am unable to resolve I will kindly ask you to report the issue to his [FrostedGlass repository](https://github.com/Gibbu/BetterDiscord-Themes/tree/master/FrostedGlass) - he will know more than I, all I do is make things look nice. :^)
